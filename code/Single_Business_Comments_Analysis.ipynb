      "my husband and i stopped here because no other restaurant was open on a sunday in the area. we have never tried vietnamese but after reading all the great reviews on yelp we gave it a try! the reviews were spot on with this place, it was so good! we had the fried tofu first and it was awesome. we both ordered the #88 mine with beef my husband had chicken. we also had tofu fried rice. all the food was delicious and very home made tasting. we loved our meal and the owner was so sweet! we don't live in the area but hope to come back and try different menu items!they are very nice and welcoming. the food is awesome as well. i always try something new when i go and i have never been disappointed. i highly recommend this place!!!please please please do yourself a favor and do not judge this book by its cover. while a tay-do may not look like much, the food makes up for it.  the pho here is fantastic and the broth is very flavorful.  go and check them out, you won't be disappointed.my friend and i stumbled on this place nearly a decade ago when we failed finding an indian restaurant.  the moment we walked in tay do's doors was the most serendipitous culinary moment of my life.  every trip to the greater cleveland area has to include dinner at tay do; it's without question.\n",
      "\n",
      "their honey garlic tofu is among the most delicious appetizers.  ever.  you get just enough to share with two-three other people (if one friend doesn't gobble it all up first), and the excess sauce tastes lovely on white rice.  the pho broth is spiced perfectly, and if you get the  #1 pho (i think), you get loads of tripe and tendon.  this may dissuade some diners, but they don't know what they're missing.\n",
      "\n",
      "the rice and non-pho noodle dishes are awesome, too.  when i decide to eat something other than pho (doesn't happen often), i get the peppered steak and tomatoes.  the meat is tender and the tomatoes give a slightly sweet tang to the dish.\n",
      "\n",
      "if only i was in cleveland right now...best vietnamese in town. 61 beef stir fry is my all time favorite asian dish anywhere !hmmmm.  where to begin?\n",
      "\n",
      "i took the family plus my parents to tay-do tonight for dinner.  none of us had been here before, but i really believe in yelp reviews.  i assured them that my fellow yelpers would not let us down.  they still had their doubts.\n",
      "\n",
      "the server didn't speak good english, so that was not a good start to the evening.  she also did not take our drink orders, she just brought us tea.  well, we had two young kids at the table, so they obviously weren't drinking tea!\n",
      "\n",
      "to start off, we ordered some spring rolls.  a few minutes later, the lady took our dinner orders.  i ordered #90, my mom ordered #88, my wife ordered #94, my dad ordered #67, and my daughter ordered #14.\n",
      "\n",
      "about five minutes later, our spring rolles arrived with some fish sauce.  they were small, but oh boy were they hot and delicious.  we dipped them in some siracha and fish sauce and they were just lovely.  my parents really liked them too!\n",
      "\n",
      "about 15 minutes later, our dinners were served one by one.  first up, my dad's chicken, rice, and black beans (#67).  we all tasted it and were very pleased with the unique flavors, fresh vegetables, and the perfection with which the dish was cooked.  i peeked into the kitchen and saw an old man cooking.  i knew then that this man was special.\n",
      "\n",
      "then my mom's dish arrived.  hers was chicken and rice noodles, among other things (#88).  i didn't try her dish since mine was the same thing, but with beef and shrimp.  then my daughter's chicken fried rice (#14) arrived.  it smelled freaking amazing!  i knew that if it tasted half as good as it smelled that i would fall in love with tay-do.  as luck would have it, the fried rice tasted even better!  i have found my next food affair.  again, i peeked at the chef knowing that this guy knows what the hell he is doing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "best fried rice i've ever had!  and that's a chinese dish!  this guy is making better chinese food than all the chinese restaurants in the area!\n",
      "\n",
      "finally, my chicken, beef, and shrimp (#90) arrived mixed with wide rice noodles.  it smelled so good and tasted even better.  i drizzled some fish sauce and siracha on the dish and that put it over the top.  it was hot, fresh, perfectly cooked, and perfectly seasoned.  i've never tasted food quite like this.  i tasted my wife's dish, which was the same as mine, save for egg noodles (#94).  i definitely recommend the rice noodles.\n",
      "\n",
      "everyone loved their meals!  on the drive home, we were still drooling because the amazing after tastes were still thrilling us.  we literally talked about the dinner for at least 15 minutes afterward.  \n",
      "\n",
      "i can't wait to go back and drill my way through the menu.  in addition to having awesome food, you can call ahead, they'll cook it, you show up, they serve you, and then you eat.\n",
      "\n",
      "love.  it's what makes vietnamese food, vietnamese food.i took my family here for their first vietnamese food experience.  even though they hadn't eaten anything like it before, they enjoyed the pho, especially on a cold cleveland day.  service was a bit slow but the woman was kind.  i'd dine here again when i'm in the area.delicious vietnamese food and a total hole in the wall.  definitely no msg in their pho which was great.  lovely folks running the place.  recommend.if i could give it more stars i would. everything tastes amazing. we have tried almost the whole menu, and while we have our favorites, literally almost everything is amazing. don't go when you are in a hurry... its a husband/wife deal and you get the food one dish at a time when its hot and fresh. best food ever.we were in th mood for pho but we really didn't want to drive the distance to superior pho so we decided it was time to try something new. yelp showed me a place closer to home which happens to be this place.  as soon as we walked in, it was empty and we got service quickly. once we got our food, people started piling in! the owner is the only one providing service so as more people come in, the service becomes slow but definitely worth it.  this place is definitely a hidden gem!\n",
      "\n",
      "the place looks pretty run down and you will sink in the booth when you sit down.  and if someone is sitting behind you and moving around.. you will definitely feel it and get pushed around if you aren't as big as the person sitting behind you.  now let's be honest..  i didn't come here to critique the area.. but to critique the food and boy oh boy! my palate is definitely satisfied!!\n",
      "\n",
      "we ordered the number 1 appetizer which was the fried egg rolls and you can tell it was homemade.  you could actually see the meat and vegetables inside the wrap.\n",
      "\n",
      "the iced coffee is definitely better here compared to what we are used to. not too sweet and you can actually taste the coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "now for the main course!!! i had the number 30 pho! when i had my first taste of the broth i was in love!!! it was clear unlike the broths i was used to and it tasted so absolutely amazing!! it's basically the cat's meow! the broth really didn't need anything to it since the broth was already full of flavor!  basically i was already full but kept drinking the broth because it is that good!! there was a generous portion of noodles but not that much meat.  the cost of the meals were very reasonable and delicious!\n",

      "i will definitely come back here with others to try more stuff.  i'm really happy i finally found a place with good pho that is close by to my house.  i honestly feel like this place will now be my go to for pho when i'm not in the chinatown area.the best food i've ever had in my life! the pho is pho-nominal and i also highly recommend the gingered beef. i go here as often as i can.my coworkers and i love this place. #39 with chicken has turned into one of my favorite dishes. if you are looking for a warm, fresh tasting soup look no further. their pot stickers are good but the dipping sauce is amazing.  tay do is becoming a weekly staple in the office.first time getting some pho from here! great food but on line menu is tough to read but they were so nice when i came in and order they told me sit down it will take a while maybe an hour and then they had me sit at one of there tables and served me jasmine tea! everything was great ! especially the squid pho!you must go here. then get the pot stickers and some pho. it's the best little hole in the wall place.came here for lunch and tried a vegetable pho with the # 60 which is lemon grass based dish.  it was delicious.  only advice i can give, is to be patient if you get an older lady helping, since she speaks very little english.the lady who runs this is a real trip. the girl in the booth behind us wanted to take her pho to-go which is a dumb idea and a waste. the little lady said \"no, you eat now!\". we tried to order the fresh rolls which is number 2 and she said \"no, number 1\". my companion insisted on 2 but she kept saying \"no, number 1!\" but did a gesture which looked like rolling a blunt. i figured out that she meant they were out of the clear rice wraps and i cleared that whole misunderstanding up. there is a $10 credit card minimum. the girl behind us wanted to settle up on her bill and was informed of this. she ordered a number 1 to bring her past the $10 threshold. she asked if it will be ready in a few minutes and the lady replied \"you will wait a long time!\" i thought that was the funniest thing ever. i thought the girl's head might explode. i wish the lady who worked here was about 30 years younger and single because i would like to marry her. it is a breath of fresh air to have honesty and frankness in the service industry. the pho was alright. i still think minh anh has the best in cleveland. even though the salt spike screws up my circulatory system for a few hours. i recommend that everybody should come check out tay-do for a fun experience. the food is pretty good but the service is even better! enjoy the show.not the best pho i have had, but the broth is top notch. also the inside is divey but i like it. the couple that run the place are the salt of the earth.you want quick service, i suggest you call in ahead of time.  even if you're eating in, they will still take your order ahead so that when you get there, you do not wait super long.  it is a mom & pop restaurant (literally, husband cooks, wife waits the tables)...be patient.  i have been coming here since fall of 2001 and can say that throughout the years, tay do has always been about great food.  don't judge based on the outdated interior.   my favorites include their fried rice, spring rolls (fresh and fried), potstickers and #21 (my 14 year old son mentions that if he had a last meal, #21 would be his request).  when it comes to their pho, i recommend those that have cinnamon broth and rice noodles.  finish off with some vietnamese ice coffee before heading into a carb comathis place is awesome!  i heard bernie kosar gets the #9.we loved taydo vietnamese restaurant. there was an adorable older vietnamese lady waited on us he didn't speak much english but she was very kind and make sure that we understood everything that we ordered on the menu. the food took a little long however it was well worth it. everything was very tasty and moderately priced. i would definitely eat there again and suggest others to do so as well.glad to find a place closer to home for vietnamese. typically go to superior pho but it's a destination for me. although not the same, it's great food in its own. spring rolls are awesome, pot stickers are the size of perogies, and the pho is great. they don't have banh mi which is one of my favorites but wouldn't hold it against them.  everything was well worth it. i'll be back for my pho fix.first large bowl of pho i have ever been able to finish - simply because it has to be one of the best broths i've tasted in a pho in cleveland.\n",
      "\n",
      "other places have more meat, some better condiments, but this one was just a solid broth, very good.  service was good - the lady was attentive and kind.  \n",
      "\n",
      "its a little whole in the wall in a strip - easy to miss, but give it a shot.  i'm going back to try one of the other multitudes of vietnamese specialties soon.ok, their pho is really good. i like most of their broths and their other food items are good as well like the shrimp fried rice. friendly customer service also. the manager is really funny my friend and i couldn't stop laughing at one point. my friend was putting a lot of the special sauce on his fried rice that was meant for the soup and the manager came over to stop him and said \"this sauce is very expensive don't use too much\" in her thick viet accent. she was being serious but it was hard to take her seriously but my friend did calm down his sauce usage. the inside is kind of whatever as is its location but that's parma, ohio for you.we went here on july 4th and they were open.  i was craving pho and decided to give it a try.  the decor and throw you off, but pho was on point and the food was good.  the old couple that worked there are nice.  if you're used to the asian mom personalities then you know what i mean.  she was nice and cool.  we meet a nice caucasian couple and they've been coming here for 9 years, and says they love the food here. i would definitely recommend this place.very good pho. portion-wise, i'd say on par with superior pho, maybe a bit better.  the broth was awesome but maybe i mixed my hoisen and srir racha sauce better :d\n",
      "\n",
      "wish they had combination meals though. pho, sandwich, drink.definitely a hole in the wall, mom and pop type place that has a nice homely feeling to it.  these types of places usually have the best food and at a reasonable price, and tay do fits the bill.  i would say this is the second best viet restaurant in cleveland, coming up just behind superior pho.\n",
      "\n",
      "the service was okay.  the lady that owns the place usually is the one waiting tables, and if it gets busy, she takes a while to get to you.  it is worth the wait though. once you put in your order, it doesn't take long for the food to come.  no, the lady doesn't have the most outgoing personality in the world, but that's just her demeanor. she is actually very kind.  her english just isn't that great. it also helps if you have a vietnamese person in your party.\n",
      "\n",
      "onto the food... i'm not that big of a pho fan *gasp*, but it was pretty good when i tried it. i usually get the bun thit nuong cha gio (bowl of vermicelli noodles with beef, spring rolls, veggies) at any vietnamese restaurant, and this one did not disappoint.  portions were standard fare. the grilled pork however was amazing, as were the spring rolls (cha gio).   also try their special fried rice.  it has a bunch of different kinds of meat, and the seasoning is amazing.  not exaggerating when i say it's the best fried rice i've ever had.  one thing i would advise against is the dumpling appetizer. they tasted like the precooked frozen ones you buy at the asian store.\n",
      "\n",
      "meals were cheap. $8-$10 per dish.this is by far the best vietnamese food in the area.  we have since moved to chicago, and as great as chicago fare is, we have not found food that comes close.   we miss going to taydo.  they are a delightful couple. they work so hard and take such care to create food that is fresh and delicious.  if they still have the crepes, that's definitely one to try. but, everything we have ordered was exceptional.  yes there is a waiting time, yes it's an older place and nothing fancy in appearance, but it is worth every minute and every dime, every time.  fond memories of a great place.  miss it dearly.thanks for the tip, yelpers! we never would have found tay do without you. \n",
      "\n",

      "everything was really great!  as food went in, superlatives kept coming out. between bites my fiance couldn't stop saying how fantastic and delicious everything we ordered was.  i believe there might have even been a declaration of \"sensational\" in there somewhere. \n",

      "(timing: the restaurant was empty when we got there at 1pm on friday and we had eaten and paid our check by 1:45)quiet strip mall location restaurant with extensive vietnamese menu.  courteous service.   vietnamese coffee was tasty, and the vermicelli noodle bowl w/ pork rolls (bun cha gio thit nuong) was delicious, as good as any i've had in vietnamese restaurants in the west (i lived in denver and phoenix previously).   recommended.i've eaten here a number of times.  i just got back from lunch and felt like i should post a review.\n",
      "\n",
      "this place is great.  it's a mom and pop shop, and it's a bit of a hole in the wall, but seating is adequate and the food the pop cooks is phenomenal.  i just had the most delicious ginger & scallion w/ chicken dish, served with rice.  it was so flavorful!awesome place! my girlfriend and i stumbled onto this gem when me moved to the area and we're glad we did. the  employees, a little woman who works the front and a man in the kitchen who cooks everything up, are the nicest people and the food is amazing! you would never think so by the looks of the place but i assure you that this place is a diamond in the rough. we come here once a week now and always get the same thing. the pho is always spot on and the chicken fried rice #14 is the best we have ever had! definitely recommend trying this place out at least once and i bet you'll keep coming back again and again.great family restaurant. montauk shop very nice people only problem takes a while here food but worth the waitfirst time trying vietnamese food. trusted the.reviews and they were right. the food was very good, looking foward to going back.definitely a solid bowl of ph, it stands up against the places on argyle here in chicago. more beef and rice noodles would be welcome, but condiments were fresh and the broth was rich and aromatic. the place was absolutely empty for the early saturday lunch i had there, and service was provided by a most pleasant and attentive woman. the decor is clean but weathered, like a good greasy spoon diner; there's been no fussing wasted on the walls that could have gone into the food. i wouldn't hesitate to bring ph newbies or addicts alike to this little gem you'd never expect in parma.tay do is a tiny little run-down vietnamese joint on the corner of stumph and snow. it is likely that if you aren't looking for it then you'll probably miss it. the shopping center is also quite dingy and when i walked in tay do i began to get a bit scared by the lack of customers patronizing the joint. it also left a lot to be desired from first sight. \n",
      "\n",
      "but, fortunately this is one of those \"don't judge a book by its cover\" type of restaurants. although it certainly isn't the best pho i've had, i can vouch for the fact that it is still quite good. a good hot bowl of pho is like medicine for your soul and this place filled that gap for me.\n",
      "\n",
      "i personally am a fan of the pho ga, but many things on the menu are good. most of them need some additional cilantro, lime or sarachi, but all of those things are available, so you'll be more than happy with the meal. \n",
      "\n",
      "the only thing i was not overly impressed with were the spring rolls. although i am a huge fan of mound and mounds of cilantro in my food, these over did it by a bit. \n",
      "\n",
      "however, spring rolls aside, the food is great and the staff are very friendly. take a gamble and go visit.\n",
      "\n",
      "note: they only accept credit cards on orders over $10 so if you get nothing but a bowl of pho, you better bring cash.i love this place. tay do has the best vietnamese food in cleveland. \n",
      "\n",
      "it's a little mom and pop shop, literally. she manages the floor and he's in the kitchen.  wait time for food and service can be slow, but be patient. it is worth the wait. \n",
      "\n",
      "the food is always fresh and delicious. the vegetable dishes are bursting with fresh cuts of vegetables. you get  broccoli tops, not broccoli stems, pea pods, mushrooms, carrots, sprouts, celery, etc the tofu is always crisp, i don't know how they do it. \n",
      "one of my favorite dishes is the lemongrass tamarind soup. it's sweet and spicy with bean sprouts, tofu, tomatoes, and celery. it's a meal of a soup. everyone loves the tofu me appetizer, fried tofu with sesame glaze.  i'm also a big fan of the black bean and tofu dish,the curry tofu with flat rice noodles, and the bun dishes (omg! i always eat the whole thing!). my step-father loves 91 and 95 chicken. the chinese dishes are excellent as well. some of the best lo mein. i have never been disappointed. the portions are generous. you get enough for lunch the next day..if you can stop eating. \n",
      "\n",
      "i hate to fault the place because they work so hard. the decor is minimalist.  basic tables, chairs, and a fake plant by the door. but i've been to fancier places the food was more expensive and not as good. since the food is made to order and they have minimal staffing there is a bit of a wait, like i said. but just go and enjoy your company. or bring a book while you wait. \n",

      "the lady running the front was adorable and i wanted to put  her in my pocket and carry her around with me.  it's not the fanciest of restaurants, but it is well-maintained and clean so i'm not sure i'd call this a \"hole-in-the-wall\"... i prefer to call it quaint.stumbled upon this on yelp (4 star vietnamese restaurant in cle??) and gathered a few friends to try it out on  a weekday.\n",
      "\n",
      "this place is a total hole in the wall, middle of nowhere, run by a husband and wife.  i would never have found this place without yelp! it was a weekday so we were the only ones there for dinner.  we were greeted immediately when we got there.  the first thing the wife asks us \"any of you vietnamese?\" i say yes and she immediately starts chatting me up.  the rest of my friends were not vietnamese so they just watched amusingly as we talked (and i struggled through my vietnamese).  the woman was so excited to chat with me, she was super sweet and friendly!\n",
      "\n",
      "after about 5-10 min of chatting, she asks what we want to order and i ask her what she recommends.  there were a few things i already was eyeing on the menu but it also sounds like she can make anything you could want (if you know what to ask for).   they have a pretty extensive menu with lots of traditional vietnamese dishes.  we originally were going to order banh xeo (vietnamese crepe) but she said it would take about 30 min to make--so maybe next time!  we decided to order canh chua tom (tamarind soup with shrimp), bun cha gio thit nuong (vermicelli with egg rolls and grilled pork), bo luc lac (shaking beef), and lemongrass chicken with vegetables (forgot what she called it on the menu).  all the dishes were tasty and flavorful.  i'd recommend them all but i think the canh chua and bo luc lac were probably my favorite.  the canh chua is a bit on the sweeter side because of the tamarind but comes with a nice assortment of veggies in it.  the beef was super tender.  \n",
      "\n",
      "i hope that people come try this place out! it's a nice find for vietnamese food in cle.  it's your typical no nonsense vietnamese restaurant that reminds me of places back home.  and next time my mom's in town i'll take her here so the owners can have a proper vietnamese conversation hahalove the chicken with rice noodles. fresh and made to order. huge portion and had to box the rest to take home. \n",

      "\n",
      "perfect home style, traditional vibe and would recommend to anybody not in a rush.the food was tasty. i ordered pho, an order of egg roles, and an order of fried rice. here's how i would rate these items:\n",
      "pho: 4/5 very clean and authentic taste.\n",
      "egg roles: 3/5 too fried, but overall good.\n",
      "fried rice: 3.5/5. the fried rice was on the sweet side, odd for my taste.amazing pho even though place looks dirty. defiantly your hole in the wall. absolutely amazingthe beef dishes are good at tay-do.  i had the tender beef cubes from the house specials section.  the beef cubes were extremely tender and perfectly cooked.  served on an assortment of salad vegetables, don't forget to dip the beef cubes into the sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "the vermicelli dishes are on par with other vietnamese restaurants i've been to in cleveland.  i ordered the beef lemongrass vermicelli and again, the beef was cooked and seasoned well.  again, a good mix of vegetables and fried onions to give the noodles more flavor.  the pork spring rolls were average, perhaps fried a little bit too long.\n",
      "\n",
      "the server was a little panicked during the dinner rush and it took a while to get our food.  but it's worthwhile to be patient.  the server was very nice and accommodating after she was less overwhelmed with customers.  apparently if you want to order a vietnamese crepe, it will take 30 minutes to make.i love this restaurant! it's better than superior pho, in my opinion. we come here once a week for pho. the potstickers and beef broccoli are delicious as well. the service is great, very friendly.3.5 stars overall. 4 stars for the food taste and quality. i rounded up on the rating because its a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant, which is my type of food :). i would have never found this restaurant on my own. one of my elite friends found this place on yelp. \n",
      "\n",
      "we met on a weekday and it was empty the 2 hours we were there. this place is owned by a husband and wife. i think the husband is the cook and the wife is everything else? she spoke primarily vietnamese. be aware there is no other staff. \n",
      "\n",
      "we ordered family style. we let our vietnamese friend place the order ;) the tamarind shrimp soup was sweeter then i normally have had, but the ingredients were fresh! the pineapple was cut in small sticks, which i almost confused for ginger. definitely recommend with some rice. the lemongrass chicken was simple, but flavorful. the vermicelli with beef on a stick, was also good, but nothing out of the normal. i prob will need to get an individual bowl for myself next time to get my noodle fix and to really enjoy the dish. last, but not least, we had the beef cubes and they were very well seasoned. nice combination to the bed of lettuce, cucumber and tomato it comes with. you don't even need the salt/pepper dip to appreciate the meat. yum! overall, the first experience was very enjoyable. \n",
      "\n",
      "now the second time on the same week, i came back with another group of friends. this time it was on a saturday. \n",
      "\n",
      "it was a party of 9. they had to combine two round tables to accommodate us. i think we may have startled the owner, because 15 minutes later she locked the door to the restaurant and would not allow anymore customers to enter. it was prob 7pm and the restaurant closed at 10pm? rest assured she did reopen the door after our meals were served and she could handle new patrons! lol. \n",
      "\n",
      "the food the second time around had some disappointments. they ran out of summer rolls, so we ordered spring rolls. tasty, but prob over cooked. they would not allow us to order crepe again bc there was no time to cook it! :( i had the beef cubes again and the taste was just as good the first time! i decided to get pho at this visit. #29. the soup smelled like cinnamon and i thought it was good, but my bf thought the soup base was bland. the noodles could have been cooked a little longer. you can pick a small or large bowl, but she never asked what size i wanted. i think she automatically gave everyone at the table a large. the meatballs were cut in slices, which made it easy to eat. my bf tried the rice dish with pork and shrimp, which he said was much better then the pho and something he would order again. they seem to use good quality shrimp here, which is a big plus. the leftover rice dish even tasted good the next day! \n",

      "\n",
      "i tried a little bit of everything from a bite of spring rolls, to a bite of #21 which is the most fantastic shrimp dish i have ever tasted! i even tried the shrimp with the shell on because it was that perfectly cooked! i ordered the pork fried rice and the #30 pho to go. the cinnamon broth in the the pho is such a great flavor combination with the meat! \n",
      "\n",
      "everything is made to order and you can tell!i stopped in here after seeing what was close and cheap and absolutely did not expect what i got to be as good as it was. i got the pho with the beef in it, i think it was the #30, and it was absolutely delicious. i went to another place downtown and got pho before, it wasnt bad but tay do blows it out of the water. i will definitely be coming back here anytime i want pho and especially to try as much as i can from their menu which is loaded with all sorts of stuff.good food, good service - always pleased when a vietnamese restaurant has more than pho and sandwiches and this place did not disappoint. yes it's a hole in the wall but who cares right?finally tried this place after hearing so much about it!\n",

      "soooo darn gooood!i really love taydo. it's owned by an adorable vietnamese couple that seem to be the only people that work here. the wife is the server and she is really sweet and kind though she doesn't speak much english. their pho is delicious, one of the best in the cleveland area. the broth is flavorful and cinnamony without being too sweet or salty. it has a rich aroma and is very satisfying. i think the quantity for the price is a little less than i've seen at other restaurants in cleveland but i'm happy to spend a little more to support a small family business like this one. the place is usually empty but i really enjoy the food! i feel like the lack of business is mostly due to the small and unassuming storefront. we actually were only able to find this place because of yelp. check it out if you're looking for vietnamese in the area :)this place is all about the food.  interior isn't much to look at.  owned and operated by older vietnamese couple with limited english skills based on hand lettered signage and kitchen conversation.  authentic good inexpensive food.mom n pop type shop. glad to find it in parma. i recommend the lemongrass shrimp & fried rice. yummy, cheap viet food.i stopped in not intending to eat, just wanting to look at the menu as a potential for dinner that night, but instead i was met with a lovely elderly woman who was too kind. due to language barriers she thought i was ordering to go, but really i just wanted to see the menu. she was so sweet and kind i decided to stay and eat. i ordered \"beef soup\" which i now know is called pho. it was an amazingly clean beef broth with rice noodles and slices of thinly cut beef. it is served with both hot garlic red chili sauce and a sweet sauce, along with what i assume were mung bean sprouts and some thai basil. it was delicious. and for a cold rainy day it was just the right kind of heart warming meal i needed. next time desire overpowers my judgement, i'll save all the pretty ladies of instagram a pointless dm and hit up tay do for some pho, because it's flavor is more satisfying than any instagram girl can offer. speaking of girls, i wouldn't take your date here, unless she likes to hear the sound of slurping noodles and callous disregard to anything she says, because deep down we both know, the soup's tantalizing flavors has more interesting complexity than that story about the one time her boss said thank you in a condescending manner ever would.loved the food here  , very nice aged couples running this place . they made really awesome friend rice and stir fried noodles . and the price is cheap .. will definitely go there againoverall: i had a craving for my mom's vietnamese cooking, so i decided to make the 40-minute trek to check this place out. it met expectations and i will definitely be coming back if i am in the area. it is the best vietnamese restaurant i've eaten at since moving from the virginia/maryland/dc area to ohio.\n",
      "\n",
      "food: we had the goi cuon (spring rolls), bun cha gio thit nuong (vermicelli noodle bowl with eggrolls and skewered pork), and pho tai bo vien (beef noodle soup with beef and meatballs).  i highly recommend the thit nuong (skewered pork) that came with the bun dish -- it was perfectly seasoned.  overall, the dishes were all carefully prepared and the ingredients stayed true to traditional vietnamese recipes. there was no msg added.  while the food was a touch underseasoned, it was certainly preferable to the heavy-handed seasoning often used at other asian-themed restaurants in cleveland.  \n",
      "\n",
      "service: the owner lady is extremely nice. she was very concerned that every customer was enjoying their meals and so frequently paused at each table to talk to the customer.  some patience is required as she is the only host and server. additionally, there is a language barrier if you do not know vietnamese.  so, if you have never eaten vietnamese food before, you may want to do your homework before coming.  but, as someone who speaks vietnamese, it was evident from her communication with the customer and her chef-husband that she wants you to enjoy the food and experience.\n",

      "if you are in a rush or have a large party call ahead, it does take some time but it's so worth it.we've eaten at just about every vietnamese restaurant in the greater cleveland area, and tay do in parma might be our favorite. it's everything a hole-in-the-wall vietnamese place should be, a true mom-and-pop (she works the front, he the back) establishment. the bun thit nuong, my standard order, is fantastic, as are the banh xeo, spring rolls, vietnamese chicken salad, and spicy beef with tomatoes. it won't win any awards for decor or location (in a truly hideous strip mall) but for anyone in the area looking to experience some real vietnamese cuisine, this is well worth the trip.this is a true mom and pop shop. the atmosphere is divey but the food is great and well priced. the service is a bit slow, but we were in no rush and found it to be relaxing. we had the #29 pho and #85 fried tofu veggie noodle magic sauce deliciousness. highly recommend!the food here is excellent and very reasonably priced! service was decently quick but the server did seem a bit impatient. i think it was just the language barrier but she did bring us complimentary hot tea (which was great considering how cold it was outside). i got the pho ga (#33) and my boyfriend got lemongrass shrimp with rice (#59) and both were very flavorful!this place is so great. we only get pho here now. it's made fresh by the husband and his wife takes our order. the spring rolls are perfect. it's on the list of the best places to get pho, but we always get here and never need to wait. the prices are ridiculous for the quality and amount of food you get. the only reason i didn't give 5 stars is that we went last time and they told us they weren't opening, the other being more than once they did not have 2 of the menu items.what a gem! this out of the way mom & pop is the best vietnamese restaurant i have ever patronized. the pho is so good. fried tofu and dumpling appetizers are consistently great. yum!  btw... they do serve \"33\"...a vietnamese beer that i like a lot. also...  try the vietnamese iced coffee for dessert.when my wife and i were dating at the turn of the century, we often ate at tay-do. back in those days, the restaurant took up two or three of the store fronts in the slightly shabby little strip plaza it occupies on snow road at york road. there used to be lots of lights, big screens, art, asian karaoke - a definitely party atmosphere accompanied by a fairly extensive menu that included many wonderful vietnamese noodle, soup, and rice dishes, stir-frys and simmering clay pot dinners with whole fish. it was just exotic enough while also being welcoming. but times and circumstances change, and tay-do is now a much smaller operation, still run by a husband and wife team in a reduced form from those days in the late 1990s. they are older now (me too!), but the food is just as good even though the offerings are much scaled back.\n",
      "\n",
      "as is my wintertime tradition, i came in for pho. the traditional vietnamese noodle soup is my go-to whenever i need a pick me up or a vaccination against whatever creeping crud is currently en vogue in the parma schools for my younger kids to anoint me with - and the pho here is good, although not quite to the the level of my go-to pho, which (against common wisdom in ne ohio) is at minh anh on detroit avenue with superior pho, the popular choice, a very close second.\n",
      "\n",
      "the broth is king in a good bowl of pho and the broth was rich and cinnamon-y with a healthy amount of coarsely cracked pepper. the noodles were good (one difference - at minh anh they make the noodles from scratch, i didn't get that sense here). i chose meatballs and rare beef; the meatballs were good as was the beef but i would have liked more of the beef. the condiments served alongside were the usual; thai basil sprouts, bean sprouts and lime but no slices of hot peppers as is often served. i am not sure if this may be a regional variation of the dish that the cook brings with them, but i like them. of course there was sriracha and hoisin sauce.\n",
      "\n",
      "all that said, i enjoyed the pho. and i'm happy that these people, these two older people, are still making delicious food in parma. when we used to eat there twenty years ago, it was a family business -  there were younger people waiting tables and even their younger children were bussing and setting tables - sadly, a family business that the now-grown children may not maintain.  i did have a brief chat with the older gentleman about the old days of the place; i wish i could come in and order the clay pot fish again! but there is enough on the current menu for me to make a few new memories with my now college-age daughter who coincidentally was born one night after we ate at tay-do. my wife went into labor in april, 1999 after eating a wonderful seafood stir-fry we knew only as g-6 on the menu. we don't think the food was the trigger, but you could definitely do worse...we ordered it so often but it's another casualty of the scaling back of the business. sad but time does pass. \n",
      "\n",
      "try tay-do if you are seeking vietnamese food in parma. it's good, and sometimes driving downtown or to gordon square doesn't make much sense. i think of it as a local place to get the medicine i'll need to survive another ne ohio winter and i hope the proprietors hang on for a good while.food was excellent !!\n",
      "however the lady that owned it had difficulty with english but it's a family owned shop and the love is there . also if your in a hurry i'd go somewhere else , it may take a little bit to get your order and food but it's fresh quality food over rushed junk in my opinion. so worth the wait. will defiantly go again soon!been in this restaurant a couple times already, my bf and i really like it, first time you go you might think the lady who works there is kinda rude but really she isn't, food tastes really good, prices are good for the amount of food you get. great vietnamese restaurant! \n",
      "fun fact: if you ever visit this place when ordering just say the number of what you want on the menu, it's easier for you and the lady.had an awesome new years day dinner there.  ordered the pho xao chay and instantly fell in love with it.  it was slightly sweet with plenty of fresh crunchy veggies. i highly recommend.  the older woman working, even though she didn't speak english very well, was helpful in helping our table order since we had a lot of vietnamese first timers with us. will definitely go back.i ordered the #29 pho yesterday to go based on the reviews and it was great! i have had pho at many places in cleveland and this is definitely the best that i have had so far and it is cheaper. not to mention it is in parma so it is even closer. the restaurant is very authentic and the woman running the store was very sweet.this place reminds me of a little chinese restaurant in sacramento that we used to go to after church most sundays.  the couple that runs the restaurant remind me of most asian grandparents -- kind of gruff, but well-meaning.\n",

      "i had the pho tai which at $6.50 was a much better deal than #1 pho's $8 bowl.  the pho was presented with pepper sprinkled over the top, which i had never seen done before.  the meat and rice noodles were good, but not exceptional.  the broth was a tad bit too oily, and seemed to be lacking a certain punch in the flavour.  still, the weather was cold and rainy, and the soup was hot and plentiful.  all in all, for the price and location, it was a pretty decent bowl of pho.excellent food. very nice owners that even taught me a little about how to eat vietnamese. ie. bahn xia pancake (sp)definitely a fan of taydo and the delicious vietnamese cuisine offered here in this home-like environment. this restaurant is located in a corner plaza off of snow road, with an abundance of parking spaces available. it's about 8 minutes from the airport, so if you find yourself flying back into believeland and in need of a hot cup of tea, a savory bowl of pho or a steaming plate of stir-fried noodles, (or all of the above...), check out taydo! if you do happen to arrive at a busy time, be prepared to wait since it's one person running the scene in the kitchen and one person taking orders in the dining area.\n",
      "\n",
      "i always begin my evaluation of pho starting with the broth. here at taydo, the broth is excellent - it's refreshing and savory, with a hint of cracked black pepper that gives a unique subtle flavor change to this popular noodle soup. the rice noodles are tasty and aplenty. the meat servings are in low proportion to the rest of this dish - i would recommend increasing the meat portion.\n",
      "\n",
      "one of my favorite dishes on the menu is pho xao ga, a stir-fried dish with flat wide rice noodles combined with an abundance of vegetables and chicken (you can also choose shrimp, beef, pork, or squid), in a sauce that i would describe as the goldilocks marinade for asian cuisine - a perfect balance of seasoning in every bite. no tastebud left behind.\n",
      "\n",
      "side note - i was so impressed to find out that the wife and husband team have been running this business for the past 19 years! so happy to be able to support a truly local community business out here in parma, and look forward to perusing the large menu selection whenever i'm in the area!very authentic vietnamese place. the lady who was serving us was an older vietnamese lady who didn't speak great english but the menu has numbered choices so it wasn't that big of a deal. i would agree with other reviewers that she came off a bit rude because of the language barrier, but overall i didn't feel that it tampered the whole experience because the food was so good. \n",
      "we ordered an order of vegetable spring rolls and i got a number 34 (pho with shrimp). spring rolls were hot and crispy when they came out. very delicious and flavorful. \n",
      "my pho had flavorful broth, came with a heaping plate of bean sprouts/cilantro, and was a great portion size. i only had 4 shrimp in my pho but they were large and perfectly cooked. i was so satisfied after finishing my bowl! the prices were also very reasonable ($8.50 for a large pho). \n",

      "as such, this place can do no wrong. it's run by a husband (chef) - wife (everything else, said kooky asian lady) team. we went with a couple who used to come here when they lived in parma. though that was years ago, she still remembered them! \n",
      "\n",
      "the food was delicious - i ordered tofu vermicelli, and the tofu came out in delightfully crispy little strips. my order sadly didn't come with fish sauce, but the sweet soy sauce was just as good! service was slow, but the wife apologized for it profusely, and like i said - this place can do no wrong.i've never had vietnamese, and decided to try it for the first time. i was craving hot pot, but i really just wanted to dine at home. after a quick search, i found taydo. my boyfriend and i got the #47, fried spring rolls and potstickers. i was absolutely blown away by it all. i had no clue food could be so amazing. the soup seemed simple, yet it was so flavorful. the potstickers and spring rolls were perfectly seasoned and cooked as well. the portions were huge! they put all of the ingredients of the soup in a separate container from the broth, so it was as fresh as can be. i will definitely be returning!this is a seriously impressive hole-in-the-wall mom-and-pop vietnamese restaurant.  the menu is very extensive (which i found exciting, after long phung on detroit closed--which was the only other vietnamese restaurant in town with a similarly large menu), and the menu has a number of dishes that you won't find at any other place in town.\n",
      "\n",
      "the food here also has its own unique flair.  it is not in-your-face in terms of how it is spiced: i found it to be more subtle and balanced, almost in the way cantonese food is subtle compared to say, szechuan or hunan food.  but it's really, really good.  the ingredients are fresh.\n",
      "\n",
      "the atmosphere is minimal.  it feels very 70's/80's and the interior is a bit bleak and looks like it hasn't been fixed up in a while.  but the prices are very low and the food is outstanding, so what can i say?  absolutely 5 stars.best pho in cleveland. get the tofu me (#5) and the dumplings (#4). lemongrass chicken is also great.this is an amazing mom and pop vietnamese hole in the wall. the food is consistently fresh and delicious. best pho in the cleveland area, hands down. we've come back time and time again to try other dishes and are never disappointed.as other reviewers have pointed out, tay do is a total dive, but aren't the dive always the best? for those not familiar with pho, it is a traditional vietnamese rice noodle soup and tay do serves up my favorite bowl of it.i loved tay do when i lived nearby in the 90's. the pho and crepes...the veggie fried rice are all wonderful. now whenever i'm back in the old neighborhood i go back to my favorite restaurant and still love it! the owners are great people. he is the cook and she serves. neither have great english but that just adds to the charm. highly recommend tay do!we were looking for something close to the airport after arriving home from vacation and the reviews for tay do looked great. \n",

      "the woman who waited on us was cute. she has enough english to get by and took good care of us. don't let first impressions keep you from checking out tay do!it is a hole in the wall place,but the food is pretty good. we have pho, crepes and spring roll. the pho and the crepes are very delicious and fresh, but the spring roll came out very dark color and i think they need to change the oil for deep fried.the service is ok since we are the only one there and her english is not very good but she is nice to us. will go back again.this little off the wall restaurant serves the best vietnamese food. a little mom and pop place with decor that's older than the hills. if you don't mind the looks, the food is the best. best pho around.this honestly is the best vietnamese in cleveland. it is a complete mom and pop place with no frills but the food is worth it. the menu is huge and you definitely order by number. the husband makes everything to order so if the restaurant is crowded you may wait a while but it's worth it. i ordered tom rim for a long time because it is a fave. the tamarind soup is to die for. the hubby only orders bo luc lac and it never disappoints. i've told others about this place and they've converted as well. best place in cleveland.when i picture a dive this is the place that always seems to come to mind.  in a strip mall off snow road in parma near cleveland.  there is an older couple running the place.  i'm guessing a husband and wife who appear to be in their 60's (or older).  he cooks in the kitchen and she waits on tables.  i've been here for lunch and dinner and there's never any more than a few tables here at a time so it works.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "the decor is old and worn.  my daughter pointed out she was sitting on duck tape.  the carpet looks like it's been here for over 20 years or more.  once you get passed the decor and language barriers the food really shines.\n",
      "\n",
      "when you order it's important to note that food comes out of the kitchen as it's ready.  so when we order spring rolls, dumplings and pho.  the order they came out was spring rolls, pho, then dumplings.\n",
      "\n",
      "spring rolls were served piping hot with what tastes like a homemade filling.  perfectly seasoned with a very tasty sauce on the side (more on that in a moment).  pho is some of the most richly flavored broth pho's i've had anywhere.  rich deep cinnamon, hint of clove, star anise, pepper.  once you get to the bottom of the bowl there are large peppercorns waiting for you.  the dumplings are homemade.  you can even see that in the pictures.  they are some of the best i've had anywhere.  tender dough, perfectly seasoned meat interior.  the soy sauce mixture has alcohol in it.  i can taste it.  but it's delicious.\n",
      "\n",
      "i ordered and took pictures of the same items on 2 separate visits.  reason i knocked them a star is because of the consistency.  spring rolls in my first visit came with a home made duck sauce.  the second visit came with duck sauce packets.  i ordered beef pho.  first visit the accompaniments came with cilantro.  second visit it came with basil.  i told them the second time not to bring sprouts as i don't use them.  not a huge deal.  maybe they serve what they can get fresh?  but the sauce irked me so they lose a star.  i don't take away for being a dive hardly ever.  i always rate the food.  still, the food is excellent.  i highly recommend a try.sure, they do things differently than other places with their pho, but it doesn't make it any less delicious.  instead of basil you get parsley.  big deal.  the broth is what counts in my opinion, and they make a quality product.  \n",
      "\n",
      "the service is really nice, but the decor is certainly wanting for some sort of an update.  you wouldn't pick this place as a \"date spot\" to impress somebody, but for a mid-week pho pick-me-up tay do does what it does, and it does it quite well.\n",
      "\n",
      "there's plenty of other options available as they have a menu that ranges from vietnamese to chinese, so most anyone should be able to find something for their tastes.great food awesome service. slight language barrier but could be do to my hearing. \n",

      "\n",
      "i ordered the fresh spring rolls (as an appetizer) and the #30 pho tai chin...a combination of rare and cooked beef along with rice noodles.  the fresh spring rolls were just that...fresh!  shrimp and veggies wrapped in a delicate roll and served with a tangy / zippy sauce.  yum!  the soup came with a typical assortment of bean sprouts, basil leaves, lime, etc. and the table also got a complimentary pot of hot tea.  the regular sized bowl was quite large and the broth had a slightly sweet taste to it (due to the cinnamon).  it was fresh and hearty with plenty of flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "the others at my table ordered a variety of different soup, noodle and rice dishes and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  this mom-and-pop run shop was just the ticket, will definitely be back.get in my belllllly. so i actually have not had my own bowl of pho probably in... three years. honestly, i don't like any of the places around cleveland; they are all ok. this place is my number one for pho. \n",
      "\n",
      "however... i tried to order probably three other dishes off the menu, and the waitress/owner/viet granny kept laughing and saying that they don't make any of that anymore. so why is it on the menu?! i want summer rolls and bahn xeo!!!\n",
      "\n",
      "also, their fish sauce was very very mild. i know i know, like \"how?!\" because fish sauce is so stinky. but it was mild, and i guess i like my fish sauce a little more aggressive.great little spot. authentic!  clean smooth pho broth.  generous portion for 8.50. summer rolls good also. freshly made. good peanut sauce. will be back.this is an awesome mom and pop vietnamese/chinese restaurant. you have the family parents cooking in the kitchen and even the grandma helping out. \n",
      "\n",
      "the vietnamese food is very traditional and great tasting. had the pho and spring rolls and they were great tasting. broth was flavorful and all the right ingredients. recommend if you are in the area for a true home style cooking.i went here a few weeks ago and i cant stop\n",
      "thinking about the amazing food!! i had pho #29 (photo) and it was so delicious especially with the sauce they give you. it also comes with bean sprouts and some leaves that tasted kind of like anise which i love so i definitely enjoyed that. the only thing is if you come here, don't expect americanized anything. it's very much authentic and the woman that served us didn't speak much english (which i dont mind, she was very lovely and did what she could to make our meal perfect). fantastic food, i wish there was another restaurant like this one closer to my house!found this little authentic place and love! food is really bomb. try the spring rolls!!really really good pho!\n",

      "we came on a saturday night and we were the only ones in the restaurant.  don't know if this is the bad part of parma or what, but other reviewers are right that nobody seems to come here. the whole place felt sort of like a run-down hole-in-the-wall mom and pop restaurant.  the experience was kind of surreal, actually.   we had a pho and a vietnamese noodle salad.  the noodle salad was pretty typical and tasted decent.  the pho broth was decent, not particularly flavorful, but the meat was overcooked and there was not enough of it.  overall, my experience was very much okay.  if there weren't better pho options in town, i guess i might come back.\n",
      "\n",
      "they don't really have chinese food on their menu.authentic...need i say more. so authentic that the lady waiting on us spoke little english and had the stereotypical gruff old asian lady attitude. but lets talk food. my pho was perfectly prepared, tasty but lacked enough meat. the fresh spring rolls were fresh and the peanut sauce was perfect. the local is a little dingy, the digs were questionable but then that's what one may expect when dining traditional vietnamese...minus the cats wandering by, vietnamese families and deliveries on vespas and old asian gents playing mahjong while chain smoking. i'd go back.i went here for pho  , and it was supposed to come with steak, beef balls, and other meat. it only came with flank steak and nothing else. the broth was also very greasy. not the best. okay, but will not be back.first the good. this is a hole in the wall i would have never stopped at if it wasn't for yelp. i'm giving it 3 stars because of the food. i had the fresh shrimp spring rolls. delicious. i followed that up with an order of pot stickers the biggest and most doughy i ever had but never-the-less​ excellent​. my wife had some sort of ginger chicken dish which she enjoyed very much.\n",

      "now the downside​. this is a mom and pop operation. when it came time to pay the bill i handed her my visa card. she says to me in broken vietnamese english​ \"what...you no have cash!\" she seemed rather indignant​ about it. i thought to myself this must be a cash-only​ joint. i turned around to look at the front door and they accept the full array of credit cards. she picks up my card and waives it around taking it to her husband cooking in the kitchen. a speedy​ vietnamese​ chatter soon ensued​. he comes out and gives me a dirty look as he ran the card. i have​ never been in a restaurant​ advertising​ they accept credits and then get pi$$ed off because i used one! these people are so f------cheap they squeak when they walk. we left the fortune cookies behind because we didn't want them to file chapter 11.this isn't where i would take an out of towner to impress them, but it is a nice hole to meet up with a girlfriend to gossip. \n",

      "\n",
      "we ordered the same thing we always get from superior pho, a pho and a vermicelli bun (sp: 3 and 3b, td: 30 and 82), to make an honesty comparison. pretty quickly we both came to the conclusion that superior pho is, well...superior. superior has a bit more flavor and definitely better flavor. this is not to say that tay-do was bad, because it wasn't. the food was fine. the 3 stars means \"a-ok,\" and tay-do was just that. if we weren't both from california, it might even have been upgraded to 4 stars (i know, that makes me sound like a d-bag).\n",
      "\n",
      "overall: not better than superior pho, but still a decent place, especially if you live in parma.pho to go was good but next time i will eat in, i had to reheat the broth which was not a problem but i still think eat in next time should be the norm. also had ginger chicken, it was okay...i thot it would come with some spicy wild type rice but it was just plain white rice, chicken an onions were good. nothing notable...\n",
      "\n",
      "again...i think eating in would be a better idea and also having an idea of what i really wanted to order would be a good idea so next time i do a little research on the menu and maybe even learn a little vietnamese so as not to get the quizzical looks of confusion!!!!\n",

      "ha!!!!the owners were a cute couple.  welcomed me when i walked in.  there were no other patrons at the time (a tuesday).  i was so excited to get my takeout home because the smells emanating from my bag was amazing.  sadly, my entrée was a little on the skimpy side.  the flavor was delicious but the amount of meat and veggies was a little disappointing.  maybe it's just me and my being used to big portions (i do love to eat haha) but it was very underwhelming.  i will try this place again to give it a fair chance and will update my review.  i hope my second experience goes a little better.  again, great flavors, just underwhelming in the portion department.i highly recommend calling the place first before coming. perhaps it was because the icy road condtions at the time of our visit, since it took us 3 tries to coordinate with their service. if you call & if their mailbox is full, dont try your luck to come because most likely no one is there at all.\n",
      "i love phò regardless of the season. but i like it most in the winter. luckily theres a healthy competition of phò restaurants in our area back home in north-central texas. & tay-do was just ok, a non revelational experience, in my humble opinion. the place is a little hidden from the main intersection. it's situated midway in a nondescript multi-use building which was easy to spot once inside the parking lot. the door signs/notices is enough to start a deep intellectual conversation once you enter the restaurant. we waited quite a while for our food to arrive as mentioned by the fellow yelpers. the appetizers (potstickers & eggroll) were good portions. greens for the soup were a little wilted or dehydrated. most of all, the soup didnt taste authentic for me. almost tasted like it was rendered from a powdered soup base. ultimately the dishes we ordered satisfied our hunger for phò & enjoyed the company of the litle old lady. btw when paying, if you flip out a credit card, she'll say \"no cash, no cash?\". & then she'll signals the cook to handle the card transaction for her. i think this little old lady runs this joint.it was ok.  superior pho was closed on july 4th so i yelped this place.  feels really mom and pop.  feels like you walked into an 80's chinese restaurant.  owner was like a typical asian grandma type- no nonsense.  we asked her to cut the spring rolls in half so we could share.  she said no.  fresh spring rolls were forgettable.  fried spring rolls were thin and crunchy.  seems like an authentic selection of vietnamese dishes.  pho broth wasn't bad- but there wasn't a ton of noodles or meat in our large bowel and the bean sprouts had seen better days.  our rice noodle dishes were ok- not mind blowing but i could imagine someone's grandma making them.  it was ok- i probably won't go back because it is kind of out of the way.tay do i do love you and your awesome iced coffee,and have been going here for years.sadly your skimpy portions on entrees make it difficult to return more than once in a while.you would also do well to clean the place up some,the bathroom and dining room are kind of gross.paint and some new carpet along with a little more attention to the cleaning would go a long way towards keeping more customers coming.\n",
      "i haven't given up on you guys and the food is always great,but the last time i came you literally served me a half a cup of five dollar coffee and such a skimpy plate of food that i left hungry and our bill was 50 bucks.yesterday, my co worker who is vietnamese took me here and even he was disappointed. pork chop was dry and didn't look good at all- like it was frozen and reheated, i'm not sure. my tendon pho did not have much meat at all- broth was good though but it it needed more meat/tendon/tripe...3 stars because the lady was super nice. small mom and pop business and i feel bad for even writing this review since i like supporting small/local businesses.this place has incredibly nice owners working here but i just wasn't that impressed with the food.oh man, i'm so conflicted.\n",
      "first this is a hole in the wall for sure. there is no ambiance or decor. the old lady pointed with one finger without speaking, just signalling for us to sit down. a little eerie...we get some noodle soups and we start eating and it's pretty tasty.\n",
      "and then i happen to notice some floating black things. must be pepper or something.... i happen to look closer.... looks like there's legs on it.... i look closer on purpose now.... multiple floating black things with legs... omg so many... ahhhhhhh\n",
      "well that's it for my meal. i'm so disgusted. we examine my partners soup. no floating black things. i got the veggie noodle soup if that matters. maybe there were things in the vegetables that they didn't wash out.\n",
      "sigh.\n",
